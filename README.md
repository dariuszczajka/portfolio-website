## General Information
- This website was build using React.js, styled-components and a few other npm packages.
- ** Currently only polish language is supported ** - but it is my priority to make it accesible to people from around the world
- My main goal while working on this project was to encounter real-life programming challanges and solve them - that's the best way of learning new stuff in my opinion.
- If you spot a bug or techniques contradictory to current good code practices - a heads-up would be much appreciated.

## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- React.js
- styled-components

## Room for Improvement

As far as i am concerned - the sky is the limit with this project. Over time i'll try to make it look as clean and as effective as it is possible. My few ideas for further project development. 

To do:
- ** English language support ** - my current priority
- Case-study sites for each project
- Contact form support

Ideas:
- Improvement of responsiveness
- Better animations 
- Complete redesign of "Skills page"
